#For this project, I used a dataset called Chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.#

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Customerid, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA'; 


#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';


#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.LastName AS Last_Name
, cust.FirstName AS First_Name
, inv.Invoiceid AS Invoice_ID
, inv.InvoiceDate AS Invoice_Date
, inv.BillingCountry AS Billing_Country
FROM chinook.customers cust;

JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.Customerid = inv.Customerid

WHERE Country = 'Brazil';


#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Agent%';


#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;


#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.LastName
, emp.FirstName
, inv.Invoiceid
FROM chinook.invoices inv

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.Customerid = cust.Customerid

JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.FirstName = emp.FirstName;


#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT inv.Total
, cust.LastName AS Cust_Last
, cust.FirstName AS Cust_First
, cust.Country
, emp.LastName AS Agent_Last
, emp.FirstName AS Agent_First
FROM chinook.invoices inv;

JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.Customerid = cust.Customerid

JOIN chinook.employees emp
ON cust.FirstName = emp.FirstName

WHERE emp.Title LIKE '%Agent%'
GROUP BY inv.Invoiceid;


#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(Invoiceid)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';


#9. What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';


#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items i

JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON i.Trackid = t.Trackid;


#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name AS Track_Name
, ar.Name AS Artist_Name
, invi.InvoiceLineid
FROM chinook.invoice_items invi

JOIN chinook.tracks t
ON invi.Trackid = t.Trackid

JOIN chinook.albums al
ON t.Albumid = al.Albumid

JOIN chinook.artists ar
ON al.Artistid = ar.Artistid;


#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS Track_Name
, m.Name AS Media_Type
, g.Name AS Genre
, a.Title AS Album_Name
FROM chinook.tracks t

JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.Albumid = a.Albumid

JOIN chinook.media_types m
ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId

JOIN chinook.genres g
ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;


#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName
, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;


#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
