# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#1. What is the average danceability and the highest tempo? Which song is closest to the average danceability?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
, Max(tempo)
, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability like '%0.68%';

#2. What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
, artist_name
, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

#3. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT MAX(popularity)
, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY MAX(popularity) DESC
LIMIT 10;

#4. What artist released the longest long?
SELECT MAX(duration_ms)
, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY MAX(duration_ms) DESC
LIMIT 1;

#5. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE track_name IN (
  SELECT track_name 
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 10);

#6. Which artist has the most songs in the top 50 list?
SELECT artist_name
, COUNT(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(artist_name) desc
LIMIT 1;

#7. What is the average liveness for songs by Olivia Rodrigo?
SELECT AVG(liveness)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo';
